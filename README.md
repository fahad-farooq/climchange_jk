Pre-processed CEDA dataset for the valley of Kashmir
Most climate datasets pertaining to the Kashmir valley available on the Internet are either cumbersome to process or only have entries for the past few decades.
As part of a research study, I used data from the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA), containing entries dating back to 1901.
The main aim of hosting the dataset on this repository is to provide a hassle free, ready to use dataset, so that researchers can avoid having to pre-process and clean the data before use.
The datasets hosted in this repository include different climate parameters; Mean Temperature (tmp), Average Maximum Temperature (tmx), Average Minimum Temperature (tmn), Precipitation (pre), Cloud Cover (cld) and Potential Evapotranspiration (pet).
